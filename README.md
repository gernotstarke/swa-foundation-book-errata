## Known Errors

We (Alexander and Gernot, the authors) apologize for all these errors. 
They should have been detected and fixed prior to printing the book - but we failed.

#### Page 118: x- and y-axis

Original text:

>Sequence diagrams show the order of the interaction visually by using the vertical x-axis of the diagram to represent time."

It should have been calles "y-axis" - time usually flows downward in sequence diagrams.

#### Chapter 3.3.2


>K-question: For each of the following statements about static UML diagrams chose if it is true or false.
>|true | false | questionÂ |
>|----|----|----|
>| x  |  | Package- and component diagrams should be avoided in software architecture, as they tend to be overly abstract.

The "x" was printed in the wrong column. Component diagrams are very useful in diagramming or modeling software architectures.
